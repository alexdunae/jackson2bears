      %p Heritage Mythologies is a Live Cinema/Scratch Video performance artwork that utilizes gesture controlled vinyl-tracking technology in conjunction with specialized software in order to edit, manipulate and ‘scratch’ audio/video media in real-time. Heritage Mythologies premiered as a part of an international artist residency/ exchange project between Canada and Ireland entitled Crossings (curated by Christine Connley). The performance was delivered in two parts; the first ‘episode’ took place at SAW gallery in Ottawa during Aboriginal Awareness Week, and ‘episode 2’ was presented at Catalyst Arts in Belfast. 

      %p The artwork incorporates elements of ‘Canadian cultural heritage’ such as video fragments of the famous Heritage Minutes that aired on CBC television in the 1990’s. The work also features a number of remixes integrating the Canadian national anthem, footage from the Oka Crisis, protests surrounding the 2010 Olympic games, and archival footage of residential schools mashed-up with parliamentary footage of the official Federal government apology in 2008. An Installation version of this work is currently being exhibited as part of the traveling exhibition “Beat Nation: Art, Hip Hop and Aboriginal Culture”, curated by Kathleen Ritter and Tania Willard.
